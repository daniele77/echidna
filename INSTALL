Installation Instructions
*************************

Requirements
============

In order to use the library and run included examples, at least this
dependency should be installed:

- boost C++ libraries.

Especially:

* if you use echidna eventbus you need the following boost libraries:
    - function
    - any
    - smart_ptr
    - thread
    - utility

* if you use echidna component container you also need the following boost libraries:
    - property tree
    - string_algo

Installation
============

Echidna library is header-only: it consists entirely of header files containing 
templates and inline functions, and require no separately-compiled library binaries
or special treatment when linking.

Extract the archive wherever you want.
This is a sketch of the resulting directory structure:

echidna\ ............................................The “echidna root directory”
   README ....................................Generic documentation about echidna
   INSTALL ............................................Installation documentation
   ChangeLog ..............................................The log of the changes
   Version .................................This file contains the version number
   echidna\ .............................................All Echidna Header files
   samples\ ....................................................Examples and test
     eventbus\ .................................A simple example of the bus event
     container\ ......................A simple example of the component container
     distributed\ ...........A demo of the bus event in a distributed environment
                     …more samples…
   doc\ .........................................A subset of Echidna library docs

Now you must only remember to insert the echidna path when compiling your source code.

Usage
=====

It's important to note the following:

The path to the echidna root directory (often C:\Program Files\echidna) is sometimes referred to as 
$ECHIDNA_ROOT in documentation and mailing lists.

To compile anything in Echidna, you need a directory containing the echidna\ subdirectory in your 
#include path.

Since all of Echidna's header files have the .h extension, and live in the echidna\ subdirectory of the
echidna root, your Echidna #include directives will look like:
  #include <echidna/whatever.h>
or
  #include "echidna/whatever.h"
depending on your preference regarding the use of angle bracket includes. Even Windows users can
(and, for portability reasons, probably should) use forward slashes in #include directives;
your compiler doesn't care.


Compilation of the samples
